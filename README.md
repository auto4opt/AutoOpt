## What does AutoOptLib provide?
AutoOptLib is a MATLAB library for automatically designing metaheuristic optimizers. It provides:

*  **Rich library of design choices** - Over 40 representative metaheuristic components for designing algorithms for continuous, discrete, and permutation problems with/without constraints and uncertainties.
*  **Flexibility to designing diverse algorithms** - Design algorithms with diverse structures in a single run, enables great possibility to find novel and efficient algorithms.
*  **Various design objectives and techniques** - Various design objectives, e.g., solution quality, runtime, and anytime performance. Different design techniques, e.g., racing, intensification, and surrogate.
*  **Good accessibility** - GUI for users to input problems, manage the algorithm design process, make experimental comparisons, and visualize results with simple one-clicks. 
*  **Easy extensibility** - Easily add new algorithmic components, objectives, and techniques by a uniform interface. 

##  What are AutoOptLib's benefits:
* **Save labor resources and time** - Human experts may cost days or weeks to conceive, build up, and verify the optimizers; AutoOptLib would saves such labor resources and time costs with today's increasing computational power. 
* **Democratize metaheuristic optimizers** - Through automated algorithm design techniques, AutoOptLib would democratize the efficient and effective use of metaheuristic optimizers. This is significant for researchers and practitioners with complicated optimization problem-solving demands but without the expertise to distinguish and manage suitable optimizers among various choices. 
* **Surpass human algorithm design** - By fully exploring potential design choices and discovering novelties with computing power, AutoOptLib would go beyond human experience and gain enhanced performance regarding human problem-solving.
* **Promote metaheuristic research** - With a uniform collection of related techniques, AutoOptLib would promote research of the automated algorithm design and metaheuristic fields and be a tool in the pursuit of autonomous and general artificial intelligence systems.
